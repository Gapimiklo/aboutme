    <p class="thick">ABOUT ME:</p><p1>My name is Gašper Mikložič. I'm 13 years old. My favourite and the best subject is math.
     I have blue eyes. I'm only 165 centimeters tall.</p1><br><br><br>
     <p2 class="thick">MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY:</p2><br>
     <p3>My friends treat me nice.. Although I don't have a lot of them. We play games on computers and outside.<br>
      I usually have lunch with my family. Sometimes, after lunch, we go to walk.</p3><br><br><br>
      <p4 class="thick">OUT OF SCHOOL:</p4><br>
      <p5>In my free time, I play games, go outside and code. I sometimes build with legos. I also read. And sometimes, when I'm really<br>
         bored, I watch movies. And last weekend I was mostly in church.</p5><br><br><br>
      <p6 class="thick">MEMORIES:</p6><br>
      <p7>One time I got a lego helicopter for my birthday. I think I was 5 years old. It took me a week to build it. I was so happy when I did.<br>
         And then it was 1 month after I finished it and my mom alredy broke it!</p7><br><br><br>
      <p8 class="thick">MY FAVOURITES:</p8><br>
      <p9>My favourite movie is Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. I think that Lord of the Rings trilogy is the best trilogy ever made.<br>
         My favourite song is Hotel California by Eagles.<br>
       My favourite book is also Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring. I really like it.</p9><br><br><br>
       <p10 class="thick">HOLIDAYS:</p10><br>
       <p11>I spend my holidays on different places, depending on which holiday it is. If it's summer holidays, I spend it on the beach and at home.<br>
         If it's one-week holidays, I spend it at home. Except for those in May. In May, me and my family usually go to Germany.<br>
         I spend Christmas and new year holiday at home or at my grandma.</p11>
